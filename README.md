## Description
These are the rules for the pig dice game:

A player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to hold: If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
